# edge-of-chaos-memory
Empirical experiments comparing first-order and second-order local dynamics under stochastic noise. Using mutual-information retention and entropy metrics with permutation controls, this work shows that second-order recursion improves memory in structured and critical regimes (e.g., Rule 110) but offers no advantage in chaotic regimes
